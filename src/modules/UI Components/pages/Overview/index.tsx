        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Ship faster</span>: Over 2,500
          open-source contributors have poured countless hours into these
          components. Focus on your core business logic instead of reinventing
          the wheelâ€”we've got your UI covered.

        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Beautiful by default</span>: We're
          meticulous about our implementation of Material Design, ensuring that
          every Material UI component meets the highest standards of form and
          function, but diverge from the official spec where necessary to
          provide multiple great options.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Customizability</span>: The library
          includes an extensive set of intuitive customizability features. The
          templates in our store demonstrate how far you can go with
          customization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Cross-team collaboration</span>:
          Material UI's intuitive developer experience reduces the barrier to
          entry for back-end developers and less technical designers, empowering
          teams to collaborate more effectively. The design kits streamline your
          workflow and boost consistency between designers and developers.
